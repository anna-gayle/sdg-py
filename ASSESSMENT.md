### Individual Assessments:

Shane Jo-Anne Bacay:

The waste management system is straightforward and pretty basic. It was truly made to fulfill academic requirements, and will need further enhancements to ever be deployed practically.

Aethebelle Cabatay:

In developing the Waste Management System with Tkinter, I acknowledge its academic simplicity and the need for practical enhancements. Despite occasional frustrations with error messages, this experience deepened my understanding of Python. Adhering to my team lead's guidance, I prioritized Pythonic code and maintained focused dedication to tasks, demonstrating resourcefulness in navigating unfamiliar territory.

Angel Anya Leona Delos Reyes:

I could not appreciate Python as much as I did Java, but that is consequence of learning a language while using it in a project that was done over the course of a week. It is frustrating trying to understand error messages when you don't know what you're doing, but it is what it is. I'm no chef, but I think I served up a mean spaghetti (code). 

Lenard Josh Delos Reyes:

I did what I had to do, what my leader told me and that's all I did. Tried to make my code pythonic from my understanding, though I get easily distracted from other stuff but when I focus on something I don't stop. When things get to unknown territory I either search the internet or ask my leader.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Project was a rush job.
- Programmers held no affection towards their project.
- Not as polished as it could've been.
